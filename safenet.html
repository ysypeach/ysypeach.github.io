      <p class="introtext projpage toppadding">Safenet is a process-driven project which focuses on the transition from research to design. It practices design reframing through a variety of methodologies and tools, such as guerrilla research, modeling, and customer journey map. The solution addresses emergency housing situations for incoming students at Carnegie Mellon University. Through scoping a problem, we created a minimum viable product which delivers maximum value, with reduced risk and development effort.</p>

      <p class="para projpage toppadding">The key of this project lies in reframing an existing problem, which lies in the middle between research and design. We followed a four step design process based on the Analysis-Synthesis Bridge Model (picture below, image courtesy of Hugh Dubberly,&nbsp;Shelley Evenson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rick Robinson). The model shows the designer moving between analysis (thinking) and synthesis (making), and between abstract and concrete ideation.</p><img class="image projpage rsmodel" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 91vw, (max-width: 767px) 49vw, (max-width: 991px) 47vw, 45vw" src="images/1_analysis-synthesis.png" srcset="images/1_analysis-synthesis-p-500.png 500w, images/1_analysis-synthesis.png 800w" width="800">
      <p class="para projpage secondpara toppadding">Based on the Analysis-Synthesis Model and using my own experience, I created the chart below to outline specific actions and tools involved in each stage. Steps 1–4 corresponds with the four quadrants of the Analysis-Synthesis Model (reading from bottom left to upper left, then moving to bottom right). Steps 5–6 are additional steps necessary in the making of concrete deliverables. The purpose of creating my own version of the design process is to think through the goals and hows' of each step, so that they can be examined for future applications.</p><img class="image projpage" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 91vw, (max-width: 767px) 78vw, (max-width: 991px) 70vw, 48vw" src="images/Model.jpg" srcset="images/Model-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/Model-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/Model-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/Model-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/Model-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/Model.jpg 2202w" width="800"></div>

      <h1 class="projpage sectiontitles">Understanding <br>"What Is"</h1>
      <p class="para projpage toppadding">The first step was gaining a detailed understanding of the current landscape. We used&nbsp;directed storytelling&nbsp;to learn about the students’ experience, from the time they learn of their acceptance through when they arrive on campus. Some of the starter phrases we used include: “Tell me about your trip to Carnegie Mellon”, “What did you do to prepare for school?” and “How did you travel to campus?” We learnt that everyone had experienced some sort of issues with transitioning to campus. To disentangle ourselves from the wildly interesting details, we used&nbsp;sticky notes to synthesize individual's experiences.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="projpage projsection">
      <h1 class="projpage sectiontitles">Modeling and Scoping <br>the Problem Space</h1>
      <p class="para projpage toppadding">The next step was moving from individualized, concrete experiences, to an abstract model of the present. We achieved this by creating a&nbsp;journey map&nbsp;of the students' experience to getting to Carnegie Mellon. This map shows all the various incidents students had trouble with during different stages of the journey, and we knew that solving for everything was not the right direction. We decided to focus on emergency housing situations, as these turned out to be one of the main stressors students experience.</p>

We generated 3 possible solutions this reframe might take shape. From here, we decided on "Airbnb amongst current and incoming students" as our best idea. We used scenarios to validate our idea: in one of them below, Allen can’t move into his apartment because the wall fell off. Allen signs up for CMUxAirBnB through a website. Now, Allen pays $x to stay with another student for two nights while his apartment is fixed.</p>

      <h1 class="projpage sectiontitles">Final Thoughts</h1>
      <p class="para projpage toppadding">Reframing can be both hard and scary. It is helpful to look at the reframing process by asking “what if” questions. “What if housing experiences were fun instead of anxiety-inducing?” “What if students are guaranteed a place to live in all instances of emergency?” “What if students are relieved of the responsibility of finding their place.” I empathize very much with the saying that language shapes thoughts just as much as thoughts shape language. Using brainstorm phrases such as "what if's" freed us of pre-conceived notions and gave us the first foothold into the unknown.&nbsp;</p>
